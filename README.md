# Cajete Prototype: A Graph Grammar Simulator

A serial implementation for a graph grammar simulator. The target CXX standard is C++17. This repo initially intends to be a proof of concept for a more complex and parallel simulator in the near future. 

Build instructions are fairly simple. Modify the builder script in the scripts directory and simply run ./scripts/builder.sh

The build will be placed out of source wherever the user defines.
